# photo-agentic-ai
This is a prototype project, where the intent is to automatically organize photos in OneDrive without the need for expensive paid AI imaging services.

# Current Status
- ImageDetection folder: a tool that uses the Owl model for image detection.  Doesn't use paid AI services.  Work in progress.
- agent.py - simple prototype agent that can be deployed to Vercel.  Intent is to hook it up to the ImageDetection tool.
